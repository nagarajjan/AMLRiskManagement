# AML Risk Management

# Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Risk Management
AML risk management is the process used by financial institutions and other entities to identify, assess, and mitigate the risks associated with money laundering and terrorist financing. It involves implementing internal controls, procedures, and policies to reduce the likelihood of illicit activities and ensure compliance with AML regulations. 
# Key elements
Risk assessment: Identify and evaluate potential vulnerabilities related to money laundering and terrorist financing within the organization, considering factors like customer types, products, services, and geographic locations.

Customer Due Diligence (CDD): Implement procedures to verify customer identities and understand the nature of their business relationships. This includes Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) for high-risk customers.

Monitoring and Reporting: Continuously monitor customer activities and relationships, especially high-risk accounts. Suspicious activity must be promptly reported to the appropriate authorities, such as the National Crime Agency (NCA) in the UK or the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) in the US.

Record Keeping: Maintain accurate records of customer interactions, transactions, and due diligence measures for a specified period (e.g., at least five years).
Training and Awareness: Regularly train staff on AML procedures and developments to enhance their ability to identify and report suspicious activities. 

# Importance
Regulatory Compliance: Ensures adherence to national and international AML standards (e.g., FATF Recommendations) and avoids significant penalties and sanctions.

Financial System Integrity: Protects the financial system from abuse by criminals and terrorists.

Reputation Management: Safeguards the organization's reputation and fosters trust with customers and partners.

Risk Mitigation: Proactively identifies and reduces exposure to illicit financial activities. 

# Challenges
Evolving Regulations: Keeping up with constantly changing national and international AML regulations.

Technological Advancements: Adapting to new technologies used by criminals for money laundering.

Data Management: Ensuring data quality, integrating data from various sources, and managing false positives and negatives from monitoring systems.

Resource Limitations: Securing sufficient budget, personnel, and technology for robust AML programs. 

# Best practices
Cultivate a strong culture of compliance, starting with senior management.

This project proposes an LLM-powered Model-Centric Protocol (MCP) for Anti-Money Laundering (AML) risk management on the Windows platform. The MCP integrates a large language model (LLM) to analyze structured and unstructured data, enhance alert generation, and provide contextual narratives for AML investigations. It is a conceptual framework designed to guide the development of a real-world application.

# 1. AML risk management process with LLM
The LLM-powered AML risk management process involves five core steps:

Data ingestion and preparation: Gather data from various sources such as transaction records, customer data, and external news feeds.
Model execution and inference: Feed the prepared data into the LLM. The LLM then analyzes this information to identify potential anomalies, flag suspicious activities, and provide risk scores.

Alert generation and case management: Trigger alerts for potential money laundering activity based on the LLM's risk scoring.

Investigation and reporting: Use the LLM to generate clear, concise narratives and provide context for alerts.

Dashboard reporting and monitoring: Visualize key AML metrics, alert trends, and investigator performance in a central dashboard.

# 2. LLM model architecture
The proposed architecture uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to ensure the LLM provides accurate, contextually relevant, and explainable insights. This helps reduce "hallucinations," where the LLM invents information.

Core LLM: Use a proprietary or open-source LLM, like GPT-4o via the OpenAI API or a fine-tuned model from Google's Vertex AI.

Vector database: Store vectorized representations of structured data (e.g., transaction details, customer history) and unstructured data (e.g., news articles, past Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs)).

Custom knowledge base: Populate the vector database with AML typologies, regulatory guidance, and internal investigation reports to provide the LLM with specialized knowledge.

Inference orchestration: Use a framework to manage the flow of data.

Vectorization: Embed incoming transaction and customer data into vector form.

Retrieval: Search the vector database for similar high-risk cases or relevant regulatory information.

Augmentation: Combine the retrieved context with the user query into a single, comprehensive prompt for the LLM.

Response generation: The LLM generates a response with a risk score, a narrative, and relevant context.

# 3. Case study and example
The suspicious activity

A financial institution observes a customer, "John Doe," receiving multiple large wire transfers from different accounts in high-risk jurisdictions over a short period. The amounts are just below the standard reporting threshold.

# Traditional rule-based approach
The traditional system would trigger alerts for each transaction because the amounts are below the threshold. A human analyst would have to manually investigate each alert, cross-reference customer information, and determine if the activity is suspicious. This process is time-consuming and prone to human error.

# LLM-powered MCP approach
With an LLM-powered system, the process is streamlined:

Data Ingestion: The system ingests all transaction data, customer information, and automatically searches external data sources for any news or sanctions related to John Doe.

LLM Analysis: The LLM receives a prompt with the collected information. It analyzes the pattern of multiple smaller transactions, identifies the high-risk jurisdictions, and cross-references this with known money laundering typologies stored in the vector database.

Alert Generation: The LLM assigns a high-risk score to the customer's overall activity, triggering a consolidated alert for the analyst.

Narrative Generation: The LLM automatically generates a narrative for the case.

"Summary: High-risk activity detected for customer John Doe. Multiple transactions from high-risk jurisdictions below reporting thresholds. Pattern resembles structuring or smurfing.

Context: Investigation of adverse media found reports of regulatory action against entities with ties to these jurisdictions.

Action: Requires immediate analyst review and potential SAR filing."

Dashboard Visualization: The alert appears on the analyst's dashboard with the risk score, narrative, and links to all supporting data.

python

import os

import streamlit as st

from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings

from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS

from langchain.chains import LLMChain

from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

from langchain.llms import OpenAI

import pandas as pd

from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

# Load data from CSV (replace with your data source)
def load_data(file_path):

    return pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Create the vector store
def create_vector_store(data):

    embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
    
    docs = [str(row) for _, row in data.iterrows()]
    
    vector_store = FAISS.from_texts(docs, embeddings)
    
    return vector_store

# Define the LLM chain with a prompt template
def create_llm_chain(llm, prompt_template):

    return LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt_template)

# Generate an AML risk analysis report
def generate_report(llm_chain, vector_store, transaction_details, news_context):

    # Retrieve relevant information from the knowledge base
    
    search_results = vector_store.similarity_search(transaction_details)
    
    context = "\n".join([result.page_content for result in search_results])

    # Prepare the prompt
    prompt_input = {
        "transaction_details": transaction_details,
        "news_context": news_context,
        "known_aml_typologies": context
    }

    # Get the LLM response
    response = llm_chain.run(prompt_input)
    return response

# Main execution for Streamlit dashboard
if __name__ == '__main__':

    st.title("LLM-Powered AML Risk Management")

    # Dummy data for demonstration
    data_path = "aml_data.csv"
    # Create a dummy CSV file if it doesn't exist
    if not os.path.exists(data_path):
        dummy_data = {
            "transaction_id": [1, 2, 3],
            "customer_id": ["C101", "C102", "C103"],
            "amount": [9000, 15000, 8500],
            "destination": ["High-Risk Country", "Domestic", "High-Risk Country"],
            "description": ["Consulting fee", "Salary payment", "Invoice payment"],
            "risk_type": ["Structuring", "Low-Risk", "Structuring"]
        }
        pd.DataFrame(dummy_data).to_csv(data_path, index=False)

    # Load the data
    aml_data = load_data(data_path)

    # Create the vector store
    vector_store = create_vector_store(aml_data)

    # Define the prompt template for the LLM
    prompt_template = PromptTemplate(
        input_variables=["transaction_details", "news_context", "known_aml_typologies"],
        template="""
        You are an expert AML investigator. Analyze the following transaction details, news, and known AML typologies to provide a risk assessment.

        **Transaction Details**: {transaction_details}
        **News Context**: {news_context}
        **Relevant AML Typologies**: {known_aml_typologies}

        Based on this information, provide a detailed risk score (1-100), a summary of the potential money laundering activity, and a narrative for the AML analyst.
        """
    )

    # Initialize the LLM
    llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)

    # Create the LLM chain
    llm_chain = create_llm_chain(llm, prompt_template)

    st.header("Generate AML Risk Report")

    transaction_input = st.text_area("Enter transaction details (e.g., 'Customer C101 received 5 transfers of $8500 from various accounts in High-Risk Country'):")
    
    news_input = st.text_area("Enter relevant news context (e.g., 'Reports of sanctions evasion involving High-Risk Country'):")

    if st.button("Generate Report"):
        if transaction_input:
            with st.spinner("Generating AML report..."):
                report = generate_report(llm_chain, vector_store, transaction_input, news_input)
                st.subheader("Generated AML Report:")
                st.markdown(report)
        else:
            st.error("Please enter transaction details.")


# Step 4: Run the Streamlit dashboard
Open PowerShell: Navigate to your project directory.

Run the script: Execute the following command.

powershell

streamlit run llm_aml_mcp.py


Access the dashboard: Streamlit will open a web application in your default browser. You can use the form to enter transaction details and news, and the LLM will generate a risk assessment.

# 5. Security and ethical considerations
Data privacy: Ensure sensitive financial data is properly anonymized or encrypted before being used by the LLM.

Transparency and explainability: The RAG approach and the prompt template help ensure the LLM's reasoning is transparent. However, continuous monitoring is necessary to prevent hallucinations.

Regulatory compliance: Use this tool as an enhancement to existing AML programs, not a replacement for human judgment. Regulatory bodies require human oversight and auditable processes.

Bias mitigation: Continuously review the model's outputs for potential biases that could unfairly target individuals or groups. Ensure the training data is diverse and representative.

Utilize a risk-based approach, tailoring controls to identified risks.

Leverage technology such as AI and machine learning for enhanced detection and efficiency.

Conduct independent testing and audits to evaluate the effectiveness of AML controls.
